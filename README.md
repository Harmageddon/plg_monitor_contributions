# Monitor: Contributions

This [Joomla!](https://www.joomla.org) content plugin extends the [Monitor](https://github.com/Harmageddon/com_monitor) component. It displays the issues and comments by every user on their contact page.

## Important note

At the moment, the contact component doesn't support plugins. Therefor, this plugin will not work before [this pull request](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/8024) is implemented in the Joomla! core.

## Requirements
